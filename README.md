<h1>Dyno Mapper GUI</h1>
This program runs on the computer connected to the Arduino Uno and provides a friendly user interface to send commands and monitor the arduino. Connection to the arduino is handled automatically, or can be selected from a list of USB ports. Commands can be sent manually or read from a text file sequentially. Measurement data is logged to a CSV file located in the parent directory of the project files.
